:wave: Hi! I'm Hawthorne, and I help people play together. In the Tower, I bring clanmembers together to help them get
more out of their experience. Here on this Slack, I provide several services to bring the whole Slack together.

*#hawthorne Channel*
The #hawthorne channel is where I provide realtime updates on what our members are up to.

<https://destiny-disco.slack.com/archives/CR0NPJWBT/p1576384243009300|Here are some instructions.>

*`/hawthorne` Command*
The command you're using now lets you customize the things I'll do for you (or not):

• `/hawthorne help` - This message.
• `/hawthorne hide 2h` - Prevents me from sharing your activity in #hawthorne for the specified time. (Time is expressed in hours, e.g. `3h`.)
• `/hawthorne unhide` - Cancels your request to prevent me from sharing your activity in #hawthorne.
• `/hawthorne list` - View the current activities of (visible) players in #hawthorne.

That's all I can help with for now. If you have other feedback, please let <@U5KLLJB6K> know!
